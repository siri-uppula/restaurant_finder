## Architecture Overview

### System Architecture
Provide a high-level overview of the system's architecture, including:
- Components
- Services
- Databases
- External integrations

For example:

```plaintext
Frontend ↔ Backend ↔ Database
```

Include a diagram (e.g., an image of your architecture).

## Design Patterns

### Applied Patterns
Design Patterns followed:
- **Singleton**: Used for ensuring a single instance of the configuration manager.
- **Observer**: Used for event-driven architecture in the frontend.
- **Factory**: Simplifies object creation for various API responses.

## Design Decisions

### Key Decisions
- **Database Choice**: Chose PostgreSQL for its relational features and scalability.
- **Framework**: Selected React.js for the frontend due to its component-based architecture.
- **API Design**: Followed RESTful principles for easy integration.
- **Backend Framework**: The project utilizes Spring Boot as the backend framework, evident from the presence of pom.xml and directories like src/main/java. Modular design with distinct directories for controllers, services, repositories, and configuration, adhering to clean architecture principles.
- **Security**:Implementation of JWT-based authentication (JwtUtil and JwtAuthenticationFilter). Security configurations are encapsulated in SecurityConfig.java.
- **Database Interaction**: Utilizes JPA repositories (UserRepository, RestaurantRepository) for ORM. Supports search and filtering features via complex queries (SearchCriteria models and DTOs).
- **API Integration**: Integrated with third-party APIs like Google Maps (MapsApiService), as evident from service files handling API responses.
- **Documentation**: Swagger integration (SwaggerConfig.java) for API documentation and testing.
